## Python Blog Template

This is a beginner project that was created to develop a simple weblog application using python and the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) web framework.

My goal for this project is to create a weblog template that can be deployed to a personal domain and changed as necessary to add the requisite personal information.  Presumably, this will require the following in addition to the python files:

* Blog index file template (main web page - Jinja2 template)
* Admin page template for adding posts (unless we can figure out a way to add posts via some other method)
* CSS file for styles
* Database to hold posts

This project will also require some UI/UX design although I want to keep it pretty simple.  Most of the design work can probably be accomplished via CSS.

Feel free to fork and make changes.  I will also be working on this and will post my own code as I go along assuming someone doesn't get there first.  I will try and create issues/projects for those interested in helping.

The Slack channel recommended the [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo) Flask tutorial.  There is also a [tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/) on the Flask website which I have worked through, although I had some issues when testing the application.  I may throw my code from that into the repo.  I believe the Head First Python book also works one through creating an application using Flask.
